# 07-ipc - Inter-Process Communication

> **Purpose:** IPC communication patterns, main↔renderer communication, process isolation, and secure communication protocols

## 📋 **Contents**

### **🔧 IPC Architecture**
- **Unified Communication:** `window.rawalite` as single communication bridge
- **Process Isolation:** Strict separation between main and renderer processes
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript interfaces for all IPC communications
- **Security:** Context isolation with secure IPC patterns

### **✅ Solved IPC Issues**
- [IPC-DATABASE-SECURITY.md](solved/IPC-DATABASE-SECURITY.md) - Secure IPC patterns for database operations
  - Main process exclusive database access
  - Secure data validation and sanitization
  - Type-safe communication protocols

### **🔄 IPC Patterns & Best Practices**
- **Database Operations:** All database access via main process IPC
- **File System Access:** PATHS system integration for secure file operations
- **Error Handling:** Standardized error propagation across process boundaries
- **Authentication:** Secure session management via IPC channels

### **🛡️ Security Considerations**
- **Context Isolation:** Complete separation of renderer and main process contexts
- **Input Validation:** All IPC inputs validated and sanitized
- **Permission Model:** Restricted API surface for renderer process
- **Data Sanitization:** Secure data transfer protocols

### **🔄 Active IPC Issues**
*Currently no active IPC issues documented*
