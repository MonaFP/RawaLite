# 14-implementations - Implementation Documentation

> **Purpose:** Detailed implementation documentation, development sessions, and feature implementation tracking

## ðŸ“‹ **Contents**

### **âœ… final/**
Completed implementations and finalized feature documentation
- Production-ready implementations
- Complete feature specifications
- Implementation lessons learned

### **ðŸ“‹ plan/**
Implementation planning and feature specifications
- Feature roadmaps and implementation plans
- Technical specifications and requirements
- Architecture decisions for upcoming features

### **ðŸ’¬ sessions/**
Development session documentation and real-time implementation tracking
- Session notes and development progress
- Problem-solving documentation during implementation
- Real-time decision making and context

### **ðŸš§ wip/**
Work-in-progress implementations and active development
- Current development work and partial implementations
- Experimental features and proof-of-concepts
- Active debugging and development sessions

## ðŸŽ¯ **Implementation Workflow**

1. **Planning Phase** â†’ `plan/` - Feature specification and technical planning
2. **Development Phase** â†’ `sessions/` + `wip/` - Active development with session tracking
3. **Completion Phase** â†’ `final/` - Completed implementation documentation
